Hi, I'm Lauren! I'm a first-year PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Munich. I work in the Centre for Astrochemical Studies, supervised by Dr. Jaime Pineda. I am interested in the physical and chemical processes involved in star and planet formation, particularly in how material is delivered down to disk scales.

Projects I am involved in
=====

[PRODIGE](https://noema-prodige.github.io/), a survey of 32 Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud, and 8 Class II protoplanetary disks in the Taurus molecular cloud.
