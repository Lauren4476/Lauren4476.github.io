Hi, I'm Lauren! 

I'm a first-year PhD student at the [Centre for Astrochemical Studies](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/CAS) in Munich, supervised by Dr. Jaime Pineda. I'm interested in the physical and chemical processes involved in star and planet formation, particularly in accretion streamers and other methods of material delivery down to disk scales.

I'm currently working in [PRODIGE](https://noema-prodige.github.io/), a survey of 32 Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud, and 8 Class II protoplanetary disks in the Taurus molecular cloud.

*Feel free to get in touch :)*
